SingleFile is a Chrome extension that helps to archive a complete page into a single HTML file.

This fork allows SingleFile to work on file:// URLs.

This fork is not in the Chrome Web Store. To install it, drag the .crx files
from WebContent/ onto Chrome's extensions screen, or enable Developer mode from
Chrome's extensions screen and Pack each extension (WebContent/core and
WebContent/ui - you'll also need to set the "dev" flag to true on line 23 of
WebContent/ui/scripts/bg/background.js).
